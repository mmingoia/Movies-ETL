## Challenge Work

### Assumptions

1. Regular expressions continue to work on most of the dataset
2. Column names do not change in the input files
3. The solutions for overlapping data of either dropping wikipedia or filling in zeros from wikipedia do not change
4. Adult Movies, movies with episodes (likely TV shows) have been dropped
5. Source files are located in the correct directory
6. PostRes is installed on the computer


Added several "try-except" blocks that will print an message to identify when errors occur.
